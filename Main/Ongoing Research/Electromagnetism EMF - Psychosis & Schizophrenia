In studies investigating the effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF) on neurotransmitters, several specific frequencies have been commonly examined. These frequencies fall within the categories of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) and extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF). Here are the most studied frequencies:

1. **Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields (RF-EMF)**:
   - **1800 MHz**: This frequency has been studied for its effects on dopamine levels in the hippocampus of adult rats, showing a decrease in dopamine after exposure [[1]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8415840/).
   - **2450 MHz**: Research has indicated that exposure to this frequency can lead to changes in serotonin metabolism, with increases in 5-HIAA (a serotonin metabolite) observed in the cerebral cortex [[1]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8415840/).
   - **900 MHz**: This frequency has been linked to alterations in glutamate and aspartic acid levels in the brain, indicating potential impacts on neurotransmitter balance [[1]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8415840/).
   - **2.856 GHz**: Studies have shown that this frequency can affect NMDA receptor subtypes in the hippocampus, which are crucial for neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity [[1]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8415840/).

2. **Extremely Low-Frequency Electromagnetic Fields (ELF-EMF)**:
   - Frequencies in the range of **3 Hz to 3 kHz** are generated by electrical systems and have been studied for their potential effects on neurotransmitter systems, although specific studies focusing on these frequencies in relation to schizophrenia are less common [[2]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6513191/).

The impact of these frequencies on neurotransmitter metabolism and transport is significant, as alterations in neurotransmitter levels can influence cognitive and emotional behaviors, potentially linking EMF exposure to neuropsychiatric conditions.

Here is a table summarizing the specific electromagnetic field (EMF) frequencies that have been most studied in relation to neurotransmitters, along with their classifications as RF EMF or ELF EMF:

| Frequency (MHz) | EMF Type  | Neurotransmitter Affected | Study Findings |
|------------------|-----------|--------------------------|----------------|
| 1800             | RF EMF    | Dopamine                 | Decrease in dopamine levels in the hippocampus of adult rats after exposure [[3]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6513191/). |
| 2450             | RF EMF    | Serotonin                | Increase in 5-HIAA (serotonin metabolite) in the cerebral cortex [[3]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6513191/). |
| 900              | RF EMF    | Glutamate                | Alterations in glutamate levels observed, indicating potential impacts on neurotransmitter balance [[3]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6513191/). |
| 2856             | RF EMF    | NMDA Receptors           | Changes in NMDA receptor subtypes in the hippocampus, affecting neurotransmission [[3]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6513191/). |
| 30               | ELF EMF   | Various Amino Acids      | Decrease in glutamate and aspartic acid levels after exposure [[3]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6513191/). |
| 100              | ELF EMF   | GABA                     | Potential alterations in GABA levels, though specific findings were not detailed [[3]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6513191/). |

### Notation
- **RF EMF (Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields)**: Frequencies typically range from 3 kHz to 300 GHz, with specific studies focusing on frequencies like 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, and 2450 MHz.
- **ELF EMF (Extremely Low-Frequency Electromagnetic Fields)**: Frequencies range from 0 to 100 kHz, with specific studies examining lower frequencies such as 30 Hz and 100 Hz.

These frequencies have been linked to various effects on neurotransmitter metabolism and transport, which can influence cognitive and emotional behaviors.
