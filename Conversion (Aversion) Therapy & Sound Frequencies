# Potential Psychological Harms of Sound-Based Conversion Therapy

While sound-based conversion therapy is not a widely documented or scientifically supported practice, it can still cause significant psychological harm to individuals who undergo it. Some potential psychological harms include:

## 1. Anxiety and Stress

* Exposure to loud or uncomfortable sounds can cause anxiety and stress, which can exacerbate existing mental health conditions.
* The use of sound frequencies as a means of "correcting" sexual orientation can create a sense of hypervigilance, leading to increased anxiety and stress levels.

## 2. Trauma and PTSD

* Aversion therapy, which has historically included the use of loud noises or other uncomfortable stimuli, can lead to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in some individuals.
* The use of sound-based conversion therapy can trigger memories of past traumatic experiences, leading to increased symptoms of PTSD.

## 3. Depression and Low Self-Esteem

* The implicit message that one's sexual orientation is "broken" or "needs to be fixed" can lead to feelings of low self-esteem, shame, and depression.
* The failure of sound-based conversion therapy to change an individual's sexual orientation can lead to feelings of hopelessness and despair.

## 4. Internalized Homophobia

* Sound-based conversion therapy can reinforce internalized homophobia, leading to negative self-talk, self-blame, and self-shame.
* This can result in difficulty accepting one's own sexual orientation, leading to delayed self-acceptance and self-identity formation.

## 5. Loss of Autonomy and Control

* The use of sound frequencies as a means of "controlling" or "changing" an individual's sexual orientation can lead to feelings of powerlessness and loss of autonomy.
* This can result in decreased self-efficacy and confidence in one's ability to make decisions about their own life.

## 6. Difficulty with Intimacy and Relationships

* The trauma and shame associated with sound-based conversion therapy can lead to difficulties with intimacy and relationships in the future.
* This can result in challenges forming and maintaining healthy, fulfilling relationships with others.

## 7. Suicidal Ideation

* The cumulative effect of these psychological harms can lead to increased suicidal ideation and behaviors, particularly in individuals who are already vulnerable to mental health issues.

It is essential to recognize that these potential psychological harms are not unique to sound-based conversion therapy but are common consequences of conversion therapy in general. Major medical organizations have condemned conversion therapy in all its forms, citing its potential for harm and lack of scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness.
