Blood flow to and within the brain differs from other organs in several key ways due to the brain's critical functions and high metabolic demand. Here are the main differences:

1. High Metabolic Demand & Constant Supply

The brain accounts for about 2% of body weight but consumes 15-20% of the body's oxygen and glucose at rest.

Unlike other organs, the brain has very limited energy storage, so it relies on a constant and uninterrupted blood supply.


2. Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB)

The BBB is a selective barrier formed by tight junctions in brain capillary endothelial cells.

It protects the brain from toxins, pathogens, and fluctuations in blood composition, unlike other organs where capillary walls allow more free exchange of substances.


3. Cerebral Autoregulation

The brain maintains stable blood flow (cerebral perfusion) despite changes in systemic blood pressure (MAP between ~50-150 mmHg).

Mechanisms:

Myogenic response: Blood vessels constrict/dilate based on pressure.

Metabolic control: Local demand (CO₂, O₂, pH) adjusts blood flow.

Neurogenic regulation: Neural signals modulate vessel tone.



4. Circle of Willis (Collateral Circulation)

A unique arterial structure at the brain's base ensures blood supply even if one artery is blocked.

Other organs generally lack this level of redundancy in their vascular supply.


5. Lower Capillary Permeability & Specialized Transport

While most organs allow free exchange of ions and molecules, the brain requires specific transporters (e.g., glucose transporter GLUT1) for nutrient entry.


6. No Lymphatic Drainage (Until Recently Discovered)

Most organs have a lymphatic system to remove waste.

The brain uses the glymphatic system, a unique mechanism using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to clear waste, particularly during sleep.


Summary

The brain receives constant, tightly regulated blood flow with high metabolic demand.

Cerebral autoregulation, the BBB, and the Circle of Willis provide unique adaptations for protection and stability.

The glymphatic system replaces lymphatic drainage for waste clearance.
