In studies investigating the effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF) on neurotransmitters, several specific frequencies have been commonly examined. These frequencies fall within the categories of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) and extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF). Here are the most studied frequencies:

1. **Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields (RF-EMF)**:
   - **1800 MHz**: This frequency has been studied for its effects on dopamine levels in the hippocampus of adult rats, showing a decrease in dopamine after exposure [[1]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8415840/).
   - **2450 MHz**: Research has indicated that exposure to this frequency can lead to changes in serotonin metabolism, with increases in 5-HIAA (a serotonin metabolite) observed in the cerebral cortex [[1]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8415840/).
   - **900 MHz**: This frequency has been linked to alterations in glutamate and aspartic acid levels in the brain, indicating potential impacts on neurotransmitter balance [[1]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8415840/).
   - **2.856 GHz**: Studies have shown that this frequency can affect NMDA receptor subtypes in the hippocampus, which are crucial for neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity [[1]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8415840/).

2. **Extremely Low-Frequency Electromagnetic Fields (ELF-EMF)**:
   - Frequencies in the range of **3 Hz to 3 kHz** are generated by electrical systems and have been studied for their potential effects on neurotransmitter systems, although specific studies focusing on these frequencies in relation to schizophrenia are less common [[2]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6513191/).

The impact of these frequencies on neurotransmitter metabolism and transport is significant, as alterations in neurotransmitter levels can influence cognitive and emotional behaviors, potentially linking EMF exposure to neuropsychiatric conditions.
