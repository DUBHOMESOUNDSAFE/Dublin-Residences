Attempting to cope with backward or reversed speech audio can have several negative impacts:

1. **Cognitive Load**: Processing reversed speech can require significant mental effort, leading to increased cognitive load and potential frustration.

2. **Misinterpretation**: Listeners may misinterpret the sounds or meanings, leading to confusion or misunderstanding of the intended message.

3. **Fatigue**: Extended exposure to backward speech can cause auditory fatigue, making it harder to concentrate and retain information.

4. **Stress and Anxiety**: The challenge of understanding reversed audio might induce stress or anxiety, especially if the listener feels pressured to comprehend it quickly.

5. **Listening Skills**: Constant exposure to reversed speech might impair normal listening skills, as it trains the brain to process sounds in a non-standard way.

6. **Social Interaction**: If used in communication, backward speech may alienate listeners or create barriers in conversations, leading to miscommunication.

7. **Distraction**: The novelty of reversed speech can become a distraction, diverting attention away from the main content or message.

Overall, while experimenting with reversed speech can be intriguing, it may lead to various negative cognitive and emotional effects.
