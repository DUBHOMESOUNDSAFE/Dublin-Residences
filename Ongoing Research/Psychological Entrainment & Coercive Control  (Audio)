Audio entrainment is a psychological and physiological phenomenon where the brain synchronizes to external auditory stimuli, such as rhythms, tones, or patterns of sound. In the context of coercive control, abusers exploit this mechanism to manipulate, dominate, and destabilize victims. By using sound intentionally, an abuser can condition the victim’s emotional and mental state, making them more susceptible to control and manipulation.

How Audio Entrainment Functions in Coercive Control:


1. Repetition and Conditioning:

Repeated exposure to specific sounds, phrases, or tones can condition the victim to associate these with specific emotions or responses.

Example: A controlling partner uses a sharp tone or specific phrase every time they want the victim to comply, creating a conditioned fear or obedience response.



2. Emotional Regulation Through Sound:

Sounds can be used to either soothe or agitate the victim, regulating their emotions in ways that serve the abuser's goals.

Example: Playing calming music after an argument to create a false sense of reconciliation, reinforcing the cycle of abuse.



1. Creating Dependence:

By controlling the auditory environment, the abuser fosters dependence on them for emotional stability or relief.

Example: Alternating between threatening sounds and comforting tones to destabilize the victim’s emotions, making them seek comfort from the abuser.



2. Disorientation and Psychological Manipulation:

Unpredictable noises or patterns of sound can create confusion or make the victim question their reality.

Example: Using random loud noises to disrupt the victim’s sleep, leading to exhaustion and impaired judgment.

3. Weaponized Silence:

The abuser enforces periods of silence, creating tension and anxiety in the victim.

Effect: The victim becomes hypervigilant, constantly anticipating the abuser’s next move.



4. Sound as a Trigger:

Using specific sounds (e.g., door slamming, shouting, or an object dropping) to evoke fear or compliance.

Example: A victim hears the abuser’s heavy footsteps and immediately feels panic due to past experiences of escalation.





1. Incessant Verbal Abuse:

Continuous yelling, insults, or demeaning phrases are used to break the victim’s self-esteem.

Effect: The victim’s brain begins to associate these sounds with worthlessness and powerlessness.



2. Gaslighting Through Sound:

The abuser uses auditory manipulation to make the victim question their perception.

Example: Playing faint noises or whispering and then denying it, making the victim doubt their senses.



3. Technological Manipulation:

Using devices like speakers or sound systems to control the victim’s environment with sound.

Example: The abuser plays intrusive sounds, such as recorded arguments or disturbing music, to agitate the victim or disrupt their peace.

4. Emotional Instability:

Victims may experience anxiety, hypervigilance, or emotional numbness due to constant auditory manipulation.



5. Loss of Autonomy:

Over time, the victim’s responses to sound become automatic, reducing their ability to make independent decisions.



6. Cognitive Impairment:

Prolonged exposure to stress-inducing sounds can lead to difficulty concentrating, memory problems, and confusion.



7. Dependence on the Abuser:

The victim may begin relying on the abuser to provide cues for emotional stability, reinforcing the control dynamic.

Breaking Free from Audio Entrainment and Coercive Control

Awareness: Recognizing patterns of auditory manipulation is the first step.

Support: Seeking help from trusted friends, family, or professional support organizations.

Reclaiming Control: Gradually reintroducing control over the auditory environment (e.g., listening to empowering music or silence of one’s choosing).

Professional Help: Therapy can help victims rebuild autonomy and heal from the psychological impact of coercive control.
