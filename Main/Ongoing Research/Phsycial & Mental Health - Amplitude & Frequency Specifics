Noise & Health Impact - Frequency & Amplitude 
The impact of sound on hearing and health depends on two key factors:
Frequency: 
Measured in hertz (Hz), this refers to how high or low a sound is. 
Humans typically hear between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz.
Amplitude: 
Measured in decibels (dB), this refers to the loudness or intensity of the sound. 
Louder sounds have higher dB levels.

Description
Health Effects
1. Low-Frequency Sounds 
(20 Hz – 500 Hz)
Deep or rumbling noises, such as engine noise or thunder.
Hearing: 
Prolonged exposure to loud low-frequency sounds can cause hearing damage.
Low frequencies are generally less damaging at the same dB levels as higher frequencies.
Physical Effects:
Low-frequency sounds, especially below 100 Hz, can be felt physically as vibrations.
Long exposure to loud low-frequency sounds can lead to fatigue, headaches, dizziness, and a feeling of pressure on the eardrums.
Psychological Effects: 
Persistent low-frequency noise has been associated with stress, irritability, and sleep disturbances, even at lower dB levels.
2. Mid-Frequency Sounds 
(500 Hz – 4,000 Hz)
This range includes most human speech, music, and typical environmental sounds.
Hearing: 
This is the range where the ear is most sensitive, particularly between 2,000 Hz and 4,000 Hz.
Prolonged exposure to sounds in this range at high dB levels can lead to noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).
Communication:
Sounds in the 1,000 Hz – 3,000 Hz range are crucial for speech comprehension.
Damage to hearing in this range can significantly impair communication and social interaction.
Psychological Effects:
Chronic exposure to loud mid-frequency sounds can cause stress, irritability, and fatigue.
Constant loud office noise can lower productivity and increase stress.
3. High-Frequency Sounds
(4,000 Hz – 20,000 Hz)
These include sounds like a whistle, alarms, or certain high-pitched electronic tones.
Hearing:
Prolonged exposure to high-frequency sounds above 85 dB can quickly lead to hearing loss.
This is particularly true in the upper-frequency range (above 4,000 Hz), often the first to deteriorate with age or noise exposure.
Tinnitus:
Exposure to high-pitched sounds can trigger or worsen tinnitus, a condition where individuals perceive ringing or buzzing in their ears, even in the absence of external sounds.
Discomfort:
Sounds above 8,000 Hz can cause discomfort or pain even at relatively low dB levels.
This can lead to headaches or concentration issues.
4. Infrasound 
(< 20 Hz)
Infrasound refers to sound frequencies below the threshold of human hearing. While we cannot consciously hear these frequencies, they can still have an impact on health.
Physical Sensations:
Infrasound can cause vibrations or a sensation of pressure in the body, particularly in the chest and abdomen.
Dizziness & Disorientation:
 Prolonged exposure can lead to dizziness, nausea, fatigue, and disorientation.
Sleep Disruption & Anxiety:
Long-term exposure to infrasound is associated with sleep disturbances and increased feelings of anxiety.
5. Ultrasound 
(> 20,000 Hz)
Ultrasound includes frequencies above the upper range of human hearing.
Hearing:
While we cannot hear ultrasound, exposure to high-amplitude ultrasonic waves can cause hearing damage if they interact with structures in the ear.
Physical Effects:
High-intensity ultrasound can cause physical discomfort, headaches, and feelings of pressure in the head.
Medical Uses:
Ultrasound is also used therapeutically in medical procedures, such as imaging (e.g., ultrasound scans) and breaking up kidney stones.


Amplitude - Decibels 

Amplitude (dB)
Description
Health Effects


Very quiet, like rustling leaves or a whisper.
Poses no risk to hearing. Not usually harmful.
30 to 50 dB
Normal conversation, quiet office sounds, or background noise.
Prolonged exposure does not typically cause hearing loss.
Constant noise can contribute to stress and difficulty focusing over time.
60 to 70 dB
Busy street noise, normal conversation, or a vacuum cleaner.
Prolonged exposure can increase stress, especially in noisy work environments.
Does not usually cause hearing damage.
80 to 85 dB
City traffic or a noisy restaurant.
Long-term exposure (over 8 hours a day) can cause hearing loss.
Risk increases with extended exposure time.
90 to 100 dB
Motorcycles, lawnmowers, or a subway train.
Hearing damage can occur after just a few hours of exposure.
Short-term exposure (even just minutes) can start to cause harm.
110 to 120 dB
Concerts, chainsaws, or sirens.
Hearing damage can occur within minutes.
Can lead to immediate ear pain, tinnitus, and stress-related symptoms like increased heart rate.
130 to 140 dB
Jet engines, firecrackers, or a jackhammer.
Hearing damage is immediate at this level.
Prolonged exposure can lead to permanent hearing loss, headaches, and physical pain due to pressure effects on the eardrum.
150 dB and above
Gunshots or explosions.
Can cause instant and irreversible damage to the hearing system.
Physical damage to the ear structures may also occur.

Low frequencies affect the body physically and can cause stress and discomfort even at moderate dB levels.
Mid and high frequencies are most damaging to hearing, especially when prolonged exposure occurs.
Sound amplitude (dB) is a critical factor in hearing loss risk, with levels above 85 dB being dangerous for long-term exposure.
Infrasound and ultrasound have unique effects, often involving physical discomfort rather than direct hearing damage.
