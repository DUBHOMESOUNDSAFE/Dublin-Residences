Mental Health - Psychosis, Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders, and Hallucinations
The impact of sound frequencies (Hz) and amplitudes (dB) on hearing, as well as their potential role in contributing to psychosis, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and hallucinations, is a topic that intersects with both neuroscience and psychiatry.
Abnormal sound perception or prolonged exposure to certain frequencies and loudness can influence mental health, particularly in individuals predisposed to psychosis or hallucinations. 
Hereâ€™s how different sound frequencies and amplitudes might affect these conditions:

Notes
 
Low-Frequency Sounds 
(20 Hz - 500 Hz)
Experienced as rumbling or vibrations. 
Examples include heavy machinery.
Below 100 Hz can mimic hallucinations; may seem like voices or threatening noises. Induces unease, fear, anxiety.
Infrasound linked to hallucinations, dread, unease. Can lead to feeling watched.
Associated with sleep disturbances, stress, and anxiety, worsening psychotic symptoms in vulnerable individuals.
[1], [2], [4]
Mid-Frequency Sounds 
(500 Hz - 4,000 Hz)
Includes human speech, vital for communication.
Common in schizophrenia, especially 1,000-4,000 Hz. Voices seem external.
Altered perception is common. Loud sounds above 85 dB can trigger stress, paranoia, psychotic episodes.
Hyperacusis: Sounds perceived as unbearably loud, increasing paranoia and fear.
[1], [2]
High-Frequency Sounds 
(4,000 Hz - 20,000 Hz)
Includes alarms, beeping sounds.
Less common but possible misinterpretations. High-pitched sounds may be perceived as voices.
Can cause sensory overload, anxiety, paranoia, delusions.

[2]
Infrasound 
(< 20 Hz)
Below hearing threshold, felt as vibrations.
Strongly associated with auditory and visual hallucinations. Causes dizziness, nausea, disconnection.
Can trigger episodes or worsen symptoms. Misinterpreted as external manipulation.


[4], 
[6]
Ultrasound 
(> 20,000 Hz)
Above hearing range, felt as pressure.
Psychosis and Perceptual Distortion: Unlikely to cause direct hallucinations but may lead to perceptual distortions, sensory overload.




[5]
High Amplitude Sounds
Loud sounds impact mental health.
Acute Loud Sounds (Above 100 dB): 
Trigger stress responses, panic, paranoia.
Chronic Noise Exposure (Above 70 dB): Linked to stress, sleep deprivation, cognitive disturbances, anxiety disorders, depression, psychotic symptoms.
