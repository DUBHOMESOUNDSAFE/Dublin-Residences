Low-frequency sound and vibrations from subwoofers can potentially contribute to feelings of paranoia or anxiety in some individuals. There are a few reasons for this:

1. Infrasound Effects (Low-Frequency Sound Below 20 Hz)

Research suggests that infrasound (often produced by subwoofers) can induce unease, dizziness, or even a sense of dread in some people. A study by Tandy and Lawrence (1998) linked infrasound exposure to reports of ghostly sensations and anxiety.

Another study by Professor Richard Wiseman in 2003 found that exposure to infrasound increased feelings of nervousness and discomfort in participants.



2. Vibrations and Their Psychological Impact

Vibrations traveling through floorboards or walls can create an unpredictable sensory environment, which may contribute to stress or heightened alertness, especially in sensitive individuals.

Constant exposure to low-frequency vibrations has been associated with physiological stress responses, including increased heart rate and cortisol release, which may exacerbate anxiety.



3. Sleep Disturbance and Cognitive Effects

Low-frequency noise and vibration can disrupt sleep, leading to sleep deprivation, which is known to increase paranoia and anxiety (Freeman et al., 2017).

Chronic exposure to noise pollution has been linked to mental health issues, including increased paranoia and stress-related disorders (Stansfeld & Clark, 2015).



4. Misinterpretation of Low-Frequency Sounds

If a person does not consciously recognize the source of the sound or vibration, they may interpret it as something ominous, leading to feelings of paranoia.


General Advice:


If you are experiencing paranoia or distress related to low-frequency noise and vibrations, it may help to:

Identify and measure the sound levels (using a decibel meter or contacting environmental noise specialists).

Use noise isolation methods (carpets, soundproofing, or repositioning speakers).

Consider whether the noise is affecting sleep or stress levels and take steps to improve sleep hygiene.
