Summary of Effects on Psychosis, Schizophrenia, and Hallucinations by Frequency and Amplitude:

Frequency Range
Amplitude (dB)
Potential Impact on Psychosis/Hallucinations
Infrasound (< 20 Hz)
70-120 dB
May cause auditory and visual hallucinations, feelings of dread, paranoia, and disorientation. 
Can worsen psychotic symptoms.
Low Frequency 
(20 Hz – 500 Hz)
70-120 dB
May induce auditory hallucinations and anxiety; chronic exposure can increase stress and paranoia.
Mid Frequency 
(500 Hz – 4,000 Hz)
85-100 dB
Auditory hallucinations often occur in this range; loud exposure can trigger stress and exacerbate psychotic episodes.
High Frequency 
(4,000 Hz – 20,000 Hz)
>90 dB
Can cause sensory overload, paranoia, and auditory misinterpretation. 
May contribute to cognitive stress in schizophrenia.
Ultrasound 
(> 20,000 Hz)
>100 dB
Rarely causes hallucinations but may induce sensory overload and confusion, contributing to psychotic symptoms.
General High-Amplitude Noise
>90 dB
Triggers acute stress, panic, and paranoia, leading to worsened psychotic symptoms and hallucinations.
