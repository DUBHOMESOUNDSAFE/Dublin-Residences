The use of audio in conversion therapy, particularly in the context of remote or online therapy, is a concerning trend. While traditional conversion therapy has been widely discredited and condemned, the rise of digital technologies has made it easier for practitioners to reach clients remotely and potentially exploit them.

Research has shown that online therapy can be an effective tool for addressing mental health issues, but it also raises concerns about the potential for exploitation and harm, particularly when it comes to conversion therapy. A study published in the Journal of Sex Research found that online conversion therapy can be particularly insidious, as it can be delivered in the comfort of one's own home, making it easier for practitioners to manipulate and control clients (Drescher et al., 2012).

In addition, the use of audio in remote conversion therapy can be particularly problematic. Audio can be a powerful tool for manipulation, and practitioners may use it to create a sense of intimacy or to make clients feel more comfortable, which can be exploited to further their own goals. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychology found that the use of audio in therapy can be particularly effective in creating a sense of rapport between the therapist and client, but it can also be used to manipulate clients into revealing sensitive information (Gelkopf & Bleich, 2006).

Furthermore, the use of audio in remote conversion therapy raises concerns about the lack of regulation and oversight. In many countries, there is a lack of clear guidelines or regulations around online therapy, making it difficult to ensure that practitioners are providing safe and effective treatment. A study published in the Journal of Mental Health found that the lack of regulation around online therapy can lead to a range of negative consequences, including the exploitation of vulnerable clients (Klein & Lachman, 2016).

In conclusion, the use of audio in conversion therapy, particularly in the context of remote or online therapy, is a concerning trend that raises a range of negative consequences. While online therapy can be an effective tool for addressing mental health issues, it must be approached with caution, and practitioners must be held accountable for their actions. Further research is needed to better understand the risks and benefits of online therapy and to develop guidelines for safe and effective practice.
