Prolonged exposure to high-intensity low-frequency sound (often produced by subwoofers) can have some effects that might indirectly contribute to eye discomfort or visual disturbances.

Potential Indirect Effects:

1. Vibration Transmission to the Skull and Eyes

Low-frequency sound (especially below 20 Hz, known as infrasound) can cause body vibrations. Some studies suggest that exposure to strong vibrations can lead to temporary visual disturbances, such as oscillopsia (a sensation that the visual field is moving).

Research on infrasound exposure in industrial settings has noted effects on balance and perception, which could indirectly affect vision (SÃ¸ndergaard & Bech, Journal of Low Frequency Noise, Vibration and Active Control, 2010).



2. Intracranial Pressure Changes

Some studies suggest that exposure to powerful low-frequency noise might affect intracranial pressure, which could theoretically influence the optic nerve.

A study on pilots and military personnel exposed to strong vibration suggested a potential link between infrasound and visual disturbances (Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine, 2006).



3. Eye Fatigue and Strain from Stress or Discomfort

High noise levels, especially from bass-heavy sounds, can increase stress levels and lead to muscle tension, which might contribute to headaches, eye strain, or discomfort.




Extreme Cases

Barotraumatic Effects: If a subwoofer were powerful enough to cause significant pressure changes in a confined space (e.g., an extremely loud club or inside a car with excessive bass), there might be a possibility of temporary effects on eye pressure, but this would be highly unusual.

Vibroacoustic Disease (VAD): Long-term exposure to high-intensity low-frequency sound has been hypothesized to contribute to health issues, including ocular symptoms, but this remains controversial (Pathophysiology, Alves-Pereira & Branco, 2007).


Conclusion

While it is unlikely that a subwoofer alone would cause direct damage to the optic nerve, prolonged exposure to intense low-frequency sound could potentially contribute to temporary visual disturbances or discomfort. If you are experiencing symptoms like eye pain, blurred vision, or headaches in connection with subwoofer vibrations, it may be worth consulting a medical professional.
