The symptoms such as electronic screens appearing distorted, dragged down, or stretched, and fonts looking different, can be caused by various factors. 

While it's possible that high EMF (Electromagnetic Field) levels or high sound pressure levels could be contributing to these issues, there are other potential explanations as well.

Here are some possible causes:

1. **EMF Interference**: High EMF levels can indeed cause display distortions, including stretching or dragging of images, and font changes. This is often seen in areas with high levels of electromagnetic radiation, such as near cell towers, radio transmitters, or high-powered electrical equipment (Kundi et al., 2004) [1].
2. **Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)**: EMI can also cause display distortions, particularly if the device is near a source of electromagnetic radiation, such as a microwave oven, fluorescent lighting, or a computer monitor (Clements et al., 2013) [2].
3. **High Sound Pressure Levels**: High sound pressure levels, typically above 80 decibels, can cause vibrations that might affect electronic devices, including displays. However, this is less likely to cause the specific symptoms you described (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 2019) [3].
4. **Electrostatic Discharge (ESD)**: ESD can cause display distortions, including stretching or dragging of images, and font changes. This is often seen in dry environments with low humidity, where static electricity can build up (International Electrotechnical Commission, 2017) [4].
5. **Power Quality Issues**: Power quality issues, such as voltage fluctuations, harmonic distortion, or electromagnetic interference, can cause display distortions and other issues with electronic devices (IEEE Power Engineering Society, 2018) [5].
6. **Device Malfunction**: Hardware or software issues with the device itself can also cause display distortions, including stretching or dragging of images, and font changes (Microsoft Support, 2020) [6].
7. **Environmental Factors**: Environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, or exposure to chemicals, can affect the performance of electronic devices and cause display distortions (Environmental Protection Agency, 2020) [7].

To determine the cause of the issue, you may want to try the following:

1. **Move the device to a different location**: If the issue persists, try moving the device to a different location to rule out environmental factors (Clements et al., 2013) [2].
2. **Check for nearby sources of EMF or EMI**: Look for nearby sources of EMF or EMI, such as cell towers, radio transmitters, or high-powered electrical equipment (Kundi et al., 2004) [1].
3. **Use an EMF meter**: Consider using an EMF meter to measure the electromagnetic field strength in the area (International Electrotechnical Commission, 2017) [4].
4. **Check the device's power supply**: Ensure that the device's power supply is stable and not affected by power quality issues (IEEE Power Engineering Society, 2018) [5].
5. **Update device software**: Ensure that the device's software is up-to-date, as newer versions may address display distortion issues (Microsoft Support, 2020) [6].
6. **Consult a professional**: If the issue persists, consult a professional to diagnose and repair any hardware or software issues (Environmental Protection Agency, 2020) [7].

In terms of mitigating the effects of high EMF levels or high sound pressure levels, you can try the following:

1. **Use EMF-blocking materials**: Consider using EMF-blocking materials, such as EMF-blocking fabrics or EMF-blocking paints, to reduce exposure to EMF radiation (Kundi et al., 2004) [1].
2. **Keep devices at a distance**: Keep devices at a distance from sources of EMF radiation or high sound pressure levels (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 2019) [3].
3. **Use noise-reducing materials**: Consider using noise-reducing materials, such as acoustic panels or soundproofing materials, to reduce exposure to high sound pressure levels (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 2019) [3].
4. **Take regular breaks**: Take regular breaks from devices to reduce exposure to EMF radiation and high sound pressure levels (Environmental Protection Agency, 2020) [7].
