Acoustic violence differs from other forms of violence primarily in its mode of delivery, effects, and perception:

### **Mode of Delivery**
- Acoustic violence is exercised through sound, such as loud noises, music, or vibrations, rather than physical force or psychological manipulation[1][2].
- It can be intentional (e.g., using sound as torture or intimidation) or unintentional (e.g., noise pollution from urban environments)[1].

### **Effects**
- Unlike physical violence, which directly causes bodily harm, acoustic violence can harm indirectly by impacting the delicate mechanisms of the ear and causing hearing loss, stress, or psychological distress[1][3].
- It is often diffuse and omnidirectional, enveloping victims and bystanders alike[2].

### **Perception**
- Acoustic violence may not always be recognized as violence because it lacks visible harm. Its effects are often cumulative and require interpretation, unlike physical violence which produces immediate pain[1][3].
- It can also serve as a public display of power, such as through loud roars or amplified sounds to intimidate or dominate[1].

This form of violence highlights the sensory dimension of harm, making it unique compared to physical or psychological violence.
