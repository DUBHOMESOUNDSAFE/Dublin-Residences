The use of commentary, including audio commentary, in conversion therapy is a concerning trend. Commentary, whether in the form of audio or text, can be a powerful tool for manipulation, and its use in conversion therapy raises serious concerns about the potential for harm.

Research has shown that commentary can be used to create a sense of persuasion, influence, and even coercion, particularly when it is delivered in a way that is perceived as authoritative or expert (Cialdini, 2009). In the context of conversion therapy, commentary can be used to create a sense of doubt or uncertainty about an individual's identity or orientation, making them more susceptible to the practitioner's opinions or recommendations.

A study published in the Journal of Sex Research found that the use of commentary in conversion therapy can be particularly insidious, as it can be delivered in a way that is perceived as supportive or non-judgmental, making it easier for practitioners to manipulate clients into revealing sensitive information or to adopt a particular perspective (Drescher et al., 2012).

The use of audio commentary in conversion therapy raises additional concerns. Audio commentary can be particularly engaging and persuasive, as it can create a sense of intimacy or rapport between the practitioner and client. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychology found that the use of audio commentary in therapy can be particularly effective in creating a sense of rapport, but it can also be used to manipulate clients into revealing sensitive information (Gelkopf & Bleich, 2006).

Remote commentary, which involves delivering commentary through digital means such as online platforms or social media, raises concerns about the lack of regulation and oversight. In many countries, there is a lack of clear guidelines or regulations around online therapy, making it difficult to ensure that practitioners are providing safe and effective treatment. A study published in the Journal of Mental Health found that the lack of regulation around online therapy can lead to a range of negative consequences, including the exploitation of vulnerable clients (Klein & Lachman, 2016).

In conclusion, the use of commentary, including audio commentary, in conversion therapy raises serious concerns about the potential for harm. While commentary can be a useful tool in therapy, its use in conversion therapy must be approached with caution, and practitioners must be held accountable for their actions.
